    'The rubber risk mitigation platform has been developed to support the [Guidelines for Sustainable Development of Natural Rubber](http://www.cccmc.org.cn/docs/2018-02/20180224085322440051.pdf), which is led by the China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals & Chemicals Importers & Exporters (CCCMC) with support from Development Seed. We sourced, processed, and produced hundreds of Gigabytes of raster and vector data layers related to risks, as well as millions of [Sentinel-2 satellite imagery](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) tiles to map rubber plantations in Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam using machine learning methodology. The platform is designed to provide a quick assessment of the expansion of natural rubber plantations around the globe and their associated social, economic, and environmental risks. The platformâ€™s users can access evaluations that assess risks to furthering sustainable and responsible natural rubber cultivation, processing, and downstream green rubber products.',
  asiaProduces:
    'Asia produces >90% of global natural rubber, primarily in monoculture, for the highest yield in limited growing areas. Rubber is largely harvested by millions of smallholders in remote, undeveloped areas with limited access to markets, imposing substantial labor and opportunity costs. Typically, rubber plantations are initially introduced in high productivity areas by state farms and big agri-business co-operations, then pushed onto marginal lands by industrial crops, and finally, become marginally profitable for various reasons. Therefore, a fair and comprehensive assessment of rubber plantation expansion and its associated risk for users and stakeholders is essential.',
