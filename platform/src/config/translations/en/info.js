## About

The [“Guidance for Sustainable Natural Rubber”](http://www.cccmc.org.cn/docs/2018-02/20180224085322440051.pdf) (hereinafter referred to as the “Guidance”) released by the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Minerals and Chemicals (CCCMC) is applicable for improving the governance capacity of enterprises engaged in natural rubber investment, plantation and operation, to identify, prevent and manage economic, social and environmental risks encountered in the process of their operations. In order to guide the upstream and downstream enterprises in the natural rubber industry, as well as relevant government departments, regulatory agencies, financial institutions and other stakeholders to timely understand and obtain risk information, manage and control the risk, and jointly achieve responsible and sustainable natural rubber investment and operation, CCCMC aims to develop an interactive platform for early warning and analysis based on the risk framework proposed in the Guidance, as an online tool to assist in the implementation of the Guidance.

_The diagram to showcase how we map rubber plantation in SE Asia with machine learning, rubber risk data sourcing, processing and serving and the platform development_

The platform was developed by CCCMC and Development Seed collaboratively.

For more information including:
- how rubber plantations were mapping with machine learning;
- how rubber risk data layers were sourced, processed and served to the platform.

You can visit the platform [data info page](https://cccmc-sustainable-rubber.surge.sh/datainfo). The data processing scripts can be found on the Development Seed's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/developmentseed/cccmc-sustainable-rubber).
