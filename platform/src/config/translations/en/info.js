## About

The [“Guidance for Sustainable Natural Rubber”](http://www.cccmc.org.cn/docs/2018-02/20180224085322440051.pdf) (hereinafter referred to as the “Guidance”) released by the China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals & Chemicals Importers & Exporters (CCCMC) is intended to improve the governance capacity of enterprises engaged in the investment, farming, and processing of natural rubber to identify, prevent and manage economic, social and environmental risks. The guidance is designed to guide multiple stakeholders’ engagements in the natural rubber supply chain from upstream sustainable and responsible rubber cultivation to downstream rubber investments. CCCMC aims to develop an interactive platform for early warning and analysis based on the risk framework proposed in the Guidance, as an online tool to assist in the implementation of the Guidance. This online tool will guide the natural rubber industry’s upstream and downstream enterprises; relevant government departments; regulatory agencies; financial institutions; and other stakeholders in understanding and obtaining risk information in a timely manner, managing and controlling risk, and jointly achieving responsible and sustainable natural rubber investment and operations.

_The diagrams showcase how we map rubber plantations in SE Asia with machine learning, rubber risk data sourcing, processing and serving, and the platform development_

The platform was collaboratively developed by CCCMC and Development Seed.

For more information including:
- how rubber plantations were mapped using machine learning;
- how rubber risk data layers were sourced, processed, and served to the platform.

You can visit the platform [data info page](https://cccmc-sustainable-rubber.surge.sh/datainfo). The data processing scripts can be found on the Development Seed's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/developmentseed/cccmc-sustainable-rubber-pub/tree/main/data-prep).
