  siteName: 'Rubber Risk Mitigation Platform',
  rubberRisk: 'The rubber risk mitigation platform is developed to support the [Guidelines for Sustainable Development of Natural Rubber](http://www.cccmc.org.cn/docs/2018-02/20180224085322440051.pdf), which is led by the China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals & Chemicals Importers & Exporters (CCCMC) with supports from Development Seed. We sourced, processed, and produced hundreds of Gigabytes of raster and vector data layers related to risks and millions of [Sentinel-2 satellite imagery](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) tiles to map rubber plantation in Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam with machine learning. The platform is designed to provide a quick assessment of global natural rubber plantation expansion and its associated social, economic, and environmental risks. The platform users can access such evaluations to assess the risks for their further sustainable and responsible natural rubber cultivation, processing, and downstream green rubber products.',
  asiaProduces: 'Asia produces >90% of global natural rubber primarily in monoculture for the highest yield in limited growing areas. Rubber is largely harvested by smallholders in remote, undeveloped areas with limited access to markets, imposing substantial labor and opportunity costs. Typically, rubber plantations are introduced in high productivity areas, pushed onto marginal lands by industrial crops and uses, and become marginally profitable for various reasons.',
