# Docs

## ADR docs

We record the architectural decisions made on this project, so that project maintainers a year from now know what went into the decisions made.

## In-context documentation

In many of the directories of the application we also provide contextual information about the files in that directory.

See the README.md files in the following directories:

- [src](../src/)
  - [components](../components/)
  - [lib](../lib/)
  - [pages](../pages/)
- [test](../test)
